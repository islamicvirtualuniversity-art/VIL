# Contact Form Error - FIXED! ✅

## The Problem
When users tried to send messages through the contact form on your `index.html` page, they were getting errors because:

1. **Missing JavaScript File**: The HTML was referencing `assets/js/form-handler.js` but the file didn't exist
2. **No Form Handler**: There was no JavaScript code to handle form submissions
3. **API Integration Missing**: The form couldn't communicate with your Flask backend

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created Missing JavaScript Files
- **`assets/js/form-handler.js`** - Main form handler for contact and admission forms
- **`assets/js/faculty-handler.js`** - Faculty navigation handler
- **`assets/js/` directory** - Created the missing directory structure

### 2. Added Form Handling Logic
The new form handler includes:
- ✅ Form validation (name, email, subject, message)
- ✅ API communication with Flask backend
- ✅ Success/error popup messages
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback
- ✅ Form reset after successful submission
- ✅ Proper error handling

### 3. Updated HTML
- ✅ Added the script tag to include `form-handler.js`
- ✅ Form now properly connects to JavaScript handler

### 4. Created Test File
- ✅ `test-contact.html` - Simple test page to verify form functionality

## How It Works Now

1. **User fills out contact form** → JavaScript validates input
2. **Form submission** → Data sent to `/api/submit-contact` endpoint
3. **Flask processes** → Saves to database + sends emails
4. **Success response** → User sees confirmation popup
5. **Form resets** → Ready for next message

## Testing the Fix

### Quick Test
1. Start Flask server: `python app.py`
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in browser
3. Navigate to contact section
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. You should see a success message popup

### Debug Test
1. Open `test-contact.html` for isolated testing
2. Check browser console (F12) for any errors
3. Monitor Flask server logs for API requests

The form now properly handles:
