# Network Connection Error - QUICK FIX 🔧

## The Problem
You're seeing: "نیٹ ورک کنکشن کی خرابی، براہ کرم اپنا انٹرنیٹ کنکشن چیک کریں"
(Network connection error, please check your internet connection)

## Most Likely Cause
You're accessing the website incorrectly. The contact form can only work when accessed through the Flask server, not by opening the HTML file directly.

## ✅ SOLUTION - Check Your URL

### ❌ WRONG WAY (Will NOT work):
```
file:///E:/office%20work/Web%20project/index.html
```
OR opening `index.html` directly by double-clicking

### ✅ RIGHT WAY (WILL work):
```
http://localhost:8000/
```
OR
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Make Sure Flask Server is Running ✅
I just restarted it for you, so it should be running now on port 8000.

### 2. Access Website Correctly ⚠️
- **Close any browser tabs** with the website
- **Open a new browser tab**
- **Type exactly**: `http://localhost:8000/`
- **Press Enter**

### 3. Test the Contact Form
- Navigate to the contact section
- Fill out the form
- Click "پیغام بھیجیں"
- Should work now! ✅

## Quick Test
Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/test-api.html
```

Click the test buttons to verify the server is working.

## Why This Happens
- **File:// URLs**: Can't make network requests to localhost
- **Flask Server URLs**: Can communicate with the backend
- **CORS**: Only allows requests from specific origins

## If Still Not Working

### Check Browser Address Bar:
- Must start with `http://localhost:8000/`
- NOT `file:///`

### Alternative URLs to Try:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
http://192.168.100.19:8000/
```

### Check Flask Server Terminal:
- Should show request logs when form is submitted
- Look for any error messages

## Success Indicators
✅ URL starts with `http://localhost:8000/`  
✅ Flask server running and showing logs  
✅ Form submits without network error  
✅ Success popup appears  
✅ Data saves to database  

Your contact form should work perfectly once you access it through the correct URL! 🎉
